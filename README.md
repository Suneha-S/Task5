Titanic Survival Analysis
This project explores the Titanic dataset to identify key factors that influenced passenger survival during the historic tragedy. Using Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, various data visualizations were created to extract insights and support model building.

Key Findings:
 1. Missing Data: Initial heatmaps revealed missing values in Age, Cabin, and Embarked. These were addressed through preprocessing, resulting in a clean dataset for analysis.
 2. Survival Indicators: Visualizations consistently showed that gender, age, fare, and passenger class were critical in determining survival:
      > Females and younger passengers had a higher chance of survival.
      > Higher fare-paying and first-class passengers were more likely to survive.
 4. Model Evaluation: A confusion matrix revealed decent predictive performance, with some misclassifications indicating areas for model refinement.
 3. Visual Tools: Pair plots, histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps were used to uncover patterns and distributions, confirming the impact of socioeconomic and demographic factors.
